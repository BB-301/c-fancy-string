# Version 0.1.1

* Added this file (i.e, `./CHANGELOG`) to the project.
* Added three new methods to the public API (in `./include/fancy_string.h`); i.e.,
  * `fancy_string_from_copied_memory`
  * `fancy_string_line_break`
  * `fancy_string_regex_string_for_match_at_index`
* Added two new examples; i.e.,
  * `./examples/fancy_string_from_copied_memory.c`
  * `./examples/fancy_string_regex_string_for_match_at_index.c`
* Updated the `./README.md` file with a note about the use of the term
`callback` throughout the project's documentation.
* Updated the `./test/main.c` file with new unit test functions for the
three new methods listed above. Also added a safety check that makes
sure that the library version returned by the `fancy_string_library_version`
method corresponds to the current project's version indicated in the 
`./VERSION` file.
